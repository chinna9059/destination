        The history of tourism at Kailasagiri can be traced back to the vision of developing Vizag's natural beauty into a haven for visitors. Since its inception, the park has been a significant contributor to the tourism portfolio of Andhra Pradesh. It gained popularity swiftly due to its natural charm, the serene environment, and the spiritual allure, mainly stemming from the giant white statues of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati.
In the early days, locals frequented the park to escape the hustle and enjoy the calmness it offered. The word soon spread to nearby cities and states, and by the turn of the millennium, Kailasagiri Hill Park had become a must-visit destination for tourists.Overall good experience. The statues of Lord Siva and Goddess Parvati are good, not as high as I had imagined, but grand enough.
Toy train ride is slow of course and has a good view toward the end. AC in coaches don't work but the mountain breeze was decent. Train starts only after there are about 30-40 passengers.
11am there wasn't much line, which helped with the Ropeway. That trip lasts 3 mins, not much of a ropeway experience, but fastest way to go up. Better views while going down...vs. going up... 1-2 pm lunch break is a strict break, so please plan accordingly.
